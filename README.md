### Exam for Credit
Open University course enrollment is required be eligible for credits. The credits are entered in the University of Helsinkiâ€™s student records. If you wish to receive university credits, you must complete an exam. The exam does not count towards your final grade, but you must pass it. You do the exam in the Moodle learning environment, which can be accessed via the Open University course page once you have signed up for the exam. The last possible date for taking the exam is 10 January 2023. Note that you must sign up for the exam by 9 January 2023, at the latest. You can only take the exam after submitting enough exercises for five credits. It is not wise in practice to take the exam immediately after submitting the critical number of exercises. The exam is the same for 5-14 credits and does not count towards your grade. https://studies.helsinki.fi/courses/cur/otm-dbf5a51d-2121-4110-af0f-f1e8f0b74fb9/_Full_Stack_Web_Development
